# TreeGame

An [incremental game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incremental_game) built using Vue and VueX. 

# Project Goals

I hope to revolutionize UI design, game design, and code efficiency of incremental games, and set a new bar for other developers to strive for. Development of this project will also better my understanding of isomorphic application development, and state management.

# Work In Progress

Currently a work-in-progress; view the current demo at [treegame.io](http://treegame.io).
